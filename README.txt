How to open
1.go to the folder named "src"
2. click on the file named "ClickMe.Jar"


If it doesn't open
1. check if you have java installed



For Linux:
some java versions don't come with javafx or openjfx so you gotta install one of those
probably sudo apt-get install openjfx, that's what worked for me
