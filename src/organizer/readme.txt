todo (not the java class)

-rename ToDo.java into something else because it's confusing with my bigger todo list
-there is no mouseevent when clicking on blank area surrounding menu icon images, fix it to include icons,
or maybe increase icon label size

--merge mousepress event into one method so i dont have to retype it multiple times with each icon


things to add
-hourglass timer
-todo list
-stretch animations
-self playing games n ai



[todo] 

-get better icon than the untitled.png i have now
